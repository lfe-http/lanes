# lanes

The lanes project offers a modestly general LFE HTTP routing library for multiple BEAM-based HTTP servers / web frameworks.

The lanes library is used to create "framework modules" which use it to implement support for the targetted framework/HTTP library. The following frameworks are at the top of our list:

* [Elli](elli.html)
* [Barista](barista.html)
* [Erlang (inets)](inets.html) (partially implemented)
* [YAWS](yaws.html) (partially implemented)
* [Nova](nova.html) (not started)
* [Cowboy](cowboy.html) (not started)
